/*Question: At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?
Answer:
Year over year growth can be used to calculate the growth of different business metrics, including: revenue, user acquisition, transaction volume etc. 
Given the limitations of the provided data, I will focus on measuring YoY for user acquisition. 
Assumptions:
* Calculation - Yearly growth is calculated as the percentage increase in new users compared to the previous year.
* User acquisition is measured based on CREATED_DATE (the date when a user signed up) .If any CREATED_DATE is missing, those users are excluded from the analysis
* Any inactive or churned users are not consideredâ€”I only focus on new sign-ups per year
* Time Frame - Annual user acquisition trends are meaningful. It could be that shorter term trends (monthly / quarterly) make more sense for fetch.
* If CREATED_DATE is missing, the user is excluded from the analysis.
* Since there is no prior year to compare to, the first recorded year is excluded from the final results
* The dataset contains users from multiple years, allowing a valid YoY comparison.
* User acquisition - Counting ids  per year accurately represents new users acquire, IDs are unique 
* Granularity - This is a high level YoY growth metric, ignoring different segmentation such as - geo, user age and active users. The breakdowns could add valuable information.
